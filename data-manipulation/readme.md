# TypeScript Exercises: Transactions Analysis

This project is a TypeScript exercise designed to analyze and display data from a transactions API. The goal is to fetch, process, and display the data in a structured and organized way while practicing TypeScript features and modular programming.

## Requirements

1. **Fetch API Data**

- Access the data from the following API:  
  `https://api.origamid.dev/json/transacoes.json`

2. **Display Data in a Table**

- Show each transaction's details in a structured table format.

3. **Perform Calculations**

- **3.1:** Calculate the total sum of transaction values.
- **3.2:** Count the number of transactions by payment method.
- **3.3:** Count the number of transactions by status.
- **3.4:** Calculate the total sales for each day of the week.
- **3.5:** Determine the day of the week with the highest number of sales.

4. **Display Statistics**

- Show the calculated statistics in a visually organized format on the screen.

5. **Organize Code into Modules**

- Structure the code into small, reusable modules for better readability and maintainability.

6. **Normalize API Data (Optional)**

- Normalize the data from the API if necessary to simplify processing and analysis.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- HTML
- CSS (optional for styling the table and statistics)
- Fetch API

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the project:

- Open the index.html file in your browser or use a development server.

## Folder Structure

- src/ - Contains all the TypeScript modules and logic.
- index.html - Entry point for the project.
- styles.css - (Optional) Styles for the table and statistics display.

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for data processing modules.
- Enhance UI with CSS or a framework like Tailwind.
- Implement error handling for API requests.
